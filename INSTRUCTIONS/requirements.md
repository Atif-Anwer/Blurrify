# Image Processing Application Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** June 7, 2025

## 1. Document Header

*(See above)*

## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1. Purpose

This document outlines the requirements for a simple, cross-platform desktop application designed for basic image viewing and manipulation. The primary goal is to provide users with the ability to open standard image files (JPG and PNG), select a specific region within the image, and apply fundamental processing operations such as blurring or cropping to that selected area.

### 2.2. Goals

*   To create a user-friendly application capable of opening and displaying `.jpg` and `.png` image files.
*   To enable users to define a rectangular region of interest on the displayed image.
*   To implement basic image processing functions (blurring, cropping) applicable specifically to the selected region.
*   To allow saving the modified image or the cropped region as a new file.
*   To ensure the application can be distributed as a standalone executable for Windows and runnable as a Python script on Linux.

### 2.3. Target Users

The target users are individuals who require a simple tool for performing basic image manipulation tasks without the need for complex or feature-rich image editing software. This includes casual users, students, or developers needing quick, focused image adjustments.

## 3. Functional Requirements

This section details the specific features and capabilities the application must possess.

### FR 3.1. Image Loading

*   **Description:** The application shall allow users to open existing image files from their local file system.
*   **Details:** Support for `.jpg` and `.png` formats is mandatory. A standard file dialog should be used.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The application provides a clear option (e.g., "File" menu -> "Open") to trigger the file selection process.
    *   The file dialog filters for and allows selection of `.jpg` and `.png` files.
    *   Selecting a valid `.jpg` or `.png` file loads and displays the image in the main application window.
    *   Attempting to open a file that is not a valid `.jpg` or `.png` results in an informative error message, and the application does not crash.

### FR 3.2. Image Display

*   **Description:** The loaded image shall be displayed within the application window.
*   **Details:** The image should be scaled to fit within the display area while maintaining its aspect ratio. If the image is smaller than the display area, it should be shown at its original size.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Upon successful loading (FR 3.1), the selected image is visible within the dedicated image display area.
    *   The image scaling adjusts appropriately when the application window is resized.

### FR 3.3. Region Selection

*   **Description:** The application shall allow the user to define a rectangular region on the currently displayed image.
*   **Details:** This should be done via a click-and-drag interaction using the mouse cursor over the image display area. A visual indicator (e.g., a dashed rectangle) should show the selected region. The selection should be cleared via a dedicated action or by loading a new image.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Clicking and dragging the mouse on the displayed image creates a visible rectangular selection boundary.
    *   Releasing the mouse button finalizes the selection.
    *   The user can initiate a new click-and-drag to redefine the selection.
    *   A button or menu option is available to clear the current selection, removing the visual boundary.
    *   Loading a new image clears any existing selection.

### FR 3.4. Apply Blur to Selected Region

*   **Description:** The application shall apply a blur effect to the pixels within the currently selected region.
*   **Details:** A standard, non-configurable blur (e.g., using PIL's `filter(ImageFilter.BLUR)`) should be applied. This operation should modify the displayed image in place. The operation should only be enabled if a region is selected.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A control (e.g., button) labeled "Blur Region" or similar is visible but disabled when no region is selected.
    *   The "Blur Region" control becomes enabled when a valid region is selected (FR 3.3).
    *   Clicking the "Blur Region" control applies the blur filter *only* to the pixels within the bounds of the selected rectangle.
    *   The rest of the image remains unchanged.

### FR 3.5. Crop Image to Selected Region

*   **Description:** The application shall modify the displayed image to be only the content within the currently selected region.
*   **Details:** This operation effectively crops the main image down to the selected rectangle. This operation should only be enabled if a region is selected.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A control (e.g., button) labeled "Crop to Region" or similar is visible but disabled when no region is selected.
    *   The "Crop to Region" control becomes enabled when a valid region is selected (FR 3.3).
    *   Clicking the "Crop to Region" control replaces the currently displayed image with the content that was inside the selected rectangle.
    *   The selection is automatically cleared after the crop operation.

### FR 3.6. Save Modified Image

*   **Description:** The application shall allow the user to save the currently displayed image (which may have been blurred or cropped) to a new file.
*   **Details:** A "Save As" functionality should be provided using a standard file dialog. The user should be able to choose the save location and filename. Support saving in `.jpg` and `.png` formats. Quality options for JPG are not required for "basic".
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The application provides a clear option (e.g., "File" menu -> "Save As...") to trigger the save process.
    *   The save file dialog allows specifying the filename and location.
    *   The save dialog allows selecting the output format (`.jpg` or `.png`).
    *   Selecting a location, filename, and format saves the *current state* of the image displayed in the main window to the specified file.

### FR 3.7. Save Selected Region As New Image (Optional, but useful for "cropping operations on a selected region")

*   **Description:** (Alternative/Addition to FR 3.5) The application shall allow saving *only* the content of the currently selected region as a new image file.
*   **Details:** This differs from FR 3.5 as it doesn't change the main displayed image but extracts a part of it. A separate "Save Region As..." functionality could be used. Support saving in `.jpg` and `.png` formats.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A control (e.g., button) labeled "Save Region As..." or similar is visible but disabled when no region is selected.
    *   The "Save Region As..." control becomes enabled when a valid region is selected (FR 3.3).
    *   Clicking "Save Region As..." opens a file dialog similar to FR 3.6.
    *   Selecting a location, filename, and format saves *only the content* within the selected rectangle as a new image file. The main displayed image remains unchanged.

*Note: Implement either FR 3.5 or FR 3.7, or ideally both if scope allows, as "cropping operations on a selected region" can be interpreted either way.*

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

This section describes the quality attributes and technical constraints of the application.

### NFR 4.1. Performance

*   **Description:** The application should perform core operations within acceptable timeframes for typical desktop usage.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Loading and displaying a 5MB JPG image should take no longer than 3 seconds on a standard desktop PC.
    *   Applying blur to a selected region covering 10% of a 5MB image should take no longer than 1 second.
    *   Cropping (FR 3.5) or saving a region (FR 3.7) of a 5MB image should take no longer than 1 second.
    *   The user interface should remain responsive during image loading and processing operations, if possible (e.g., show a progress indicator or disable UI elements).

### NFR 4.2. Usability

*   **Description:** The application shall have an intuitive user interface that is easy to navigate and understand for users familiar with basic desktop applications.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Core functions (Open, Select Region, Blur, Crop, Save) are clearly labeled and accessible via buttons or menu items.
    *   Error messages are informative and help the user understand what went wrong and how to potentially fix it.
    *   The process for selecting a region is visually intuitive.

### NFR 4.3. Reliability

*   **Description:** The application shall handle unexpected situations gracefully without crashing.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Attempting file operations (open, save) on invalid or inaccessible paths displays an appropriate error message.
    *   Attempting to perform processing operations (blur, crop) without an image loaded or a region selected results in an error message or disabled controls.
    *   Loading corrupted or malformed image files results in an error message rather than a crash.

### NFR 4.4. Portability & Packaging

*   **Description:** The application shall be deployable on target platforms as specified.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   **Windows:** A standalone executable package can be created (e.g., using PyInstaller) that runs on Windows 10/11 without requiring a separate Python installation or manual dependency installation.
    *   **Linux:** The application can be run directly as a Python script (`python main.py`) on common Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora) provided Python and required libraries (Pillow, PyQt) are installed.

### NFR 4.5. Technical

*   **Description:** The application shall be implemented using the specified technology stack.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The core logic and UI are built using Python.
    *   Image processing relies on the Pillow (PIL) library.
    *   The graphical user interface is built using PyQt (PyQt5 or PyQt6).

## 5. Dependencies and Constraints

### 5.1. Dependencies

*   **Software:**
    *   Python 3.7+
    *   Pillow library (`pip install Pillow`)
    *   PyQt library (`pip install PyQt5` or `pip install PyQt6`)
    *   PyInstaller (for Windows packaging - `pip install pyinstaller`)
*   **Operating System:**
    *   Windows 10/11 (for executable)
    *   Linux distributions with Python 3 installed (for script)

### 5.2. Constraints

*   **Image Formats:** Limited strictly to JPG and PNG. No support for GIF, BMP, TIFF, etc.
*   **Processing Operations:** Limited strictly to region-based blur and crop. No global adjustments, filters, resizing, rotation, text overlay, etc.
*   **Region Shape:** Limited strictly to rectangular selections.
*   **User Interface:** A single main window application is expected; complex multi-window or document interface is not required.
*   **Platform Support:** macOS is explicitly not a target platform for this initial version.

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Risk 6.1. PyInstaller Packaging Complexity

*   **Description:** Creating a robust, single executable using PyInstaller can sometimes be challenging due to hidden dependencies, library paths, or anti-virus false positives.
*   **Impact:** High - Could prevent successful distribution on Windows.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium.
*   **Mitigation:** Use standard PyInstaller practices, test packaging on clean Windows environments, document any necessary workarounds (e.g., using `--add-data`, `--hidden-import`), consider distributing as a folder instead of a single `.exe` if issues persist.

### Risk 6.2. Performance Bottlenecks with Large Images

*   **Description:** Processing very large images (e.g., > 50MB or high resolution) might consume significant memory and CPU, potentially leading to unresponsiveness or crashes.
*   **Impact:** Medium - Could limit usability for some users or image types.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on typical user image sizes).
*   **Mitigation:** Implement basic memory usage monitoring, test with larger images during development, provide user feedback during long operations, potentially add a warning for extremely large files upon opening.

### Risk 6.3. Compatibility Issues (Python/Pillow/PyQt)

*   **Description:** Version mismatches between Python, Pillow, and PyQt could lead to unexpected errors or crashes.
*   **Impact:** High - Core functionality could fail.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depending on how specific version requirements are).
*   **Mitigation:** Specify exact or minimum required versions in `requirements.txt`, use virtual environments during development, test builds with the defined dependency versions.

### Risk 6.4. User Expectation Mismatch

*   **Description:** Users might interpret "basic image processing" more broadly and expect features beyond region blur/crop (e.g., global brightness, contrast, filters).
*   **Impact:** Low - Doesn't break the software, but might lead to user dissatisfaction.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium.
*   **Mitigation:** Clearly state the application's limited scope in any accompanying documentation or application "About" box. Adhere strictly to the requirements outlined in this document.
