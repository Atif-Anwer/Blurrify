# Technology Stack Recommendation: Image Processing Desktop App

## 1. Document Header
*   **Version:** 1.0
*   **Date:** June 7, 2025

## 2. Technology Summary

This document outlines the recommended technology stack for a desktop application capable of opening and performing basic image processing (blur, crop on selected regions) on JPG and PNG files. The core architecture is based on a monolithic desktop application structure leveraging Python, PyQt for the user interface, and Pillow (PIL) for image manipulation. The application will run locally on the user's machine, without requiring a separate server or database. Deployment strategies will focus on packaging for Windows and script distribution for Linux.

## 3. Frontend Recommendations

*   **Framework:** **PyQt**
    *   **Justification:** PyQt is a mature, powerful, and well-documented Python binding for the Qt cross-platform C++ framework. It provides a rich set of widgets necessary for building a responsive and interactive graphical user interface (GUI), including capabilities for displaying images, handling mouse events for region selection, and integrating with the image processing logic. Its cross-platform nature supports the requirement to run on both Windows and Linux.
*   **State Management:** **Integrated within PyQt Application Logic**
    *   **Justification:** For a relatively simple desktop application handling a single image at a time, complex state management frameworks are unnecessary. Application state (like the currently loaded image data, file path, selected region coordinates, applied operations history - if needed) can be managed directly within the main application window class or dedicated helper classes, leveraging PyQt's signal/slot mechanism for communication between UI components and the core logic.
*   **UI Libraries:** **Standard PyQt Widgets**
    *   **Justification:** PyQt's extensive library of built-in widgets (QLabel for image display, QSlider for blur intensity, QPushButton for actions, QGraphicsView/QGraphicsScene for more complex selection overlays) is sufficient to build the required user interface elements without relying on additional third-party UI libraries beyond PyQt itself.

## 4. Backend Recommendations

*   **Language:** **Python**
    *   **Justification:** As requested, Python is the core language. Its suitability for scripting, combined with powerful libraries for image processing (Pillow) and GUI development (PyQt), makes it an excellent choice for this application's integrated logic.
*   **Framework:** **Integrated Logic (No Separate Framework)**
    *   **Justification:** In this desktop application architecture, the "backend" functionality (image file loading/saving, image processing algorithms) runs within the same process as the GUI. There is no need for a separate web framework (like Flask or Django) or an API design, as the GUI directly interacts with the core logic libraries.
*   **Core Logic Library:** **Pillow (PIL Fork)**
    *   **Justification:** Pillow is the de facto standard library for image manipulation in Python. It provides comprehensive functionalities for opening, manipulating, and saving various image file formats (including JPG and PNG). It offers efficient methods for operations like blurring, cropping, and handling image data, directly supporting the core requirements.
*   **API Design:** **Internal Library/Module Structure**
    *   **Justification:** Since there is no external API, the "API design" refers to how the image processing logic is structured internally. It is recommended to organize the image processing functions (using Pillow) into separate modules or classes that can be easily called by the PyQt UI components, promoting modularity and testability within the single-process application.

## 5. Database Selection

*   **Database Type:** **None Required for Core Functionality**
    *   **Justification:** Based on the current requirements (open, process, save a single image file), there is no need for a database. The application operates on individual files directly, and no persistent storage of application state, user data, or image history is requested.
*   **Schema Approach:** **N/A**
    *   **Justification:** As no database is used, a schema approach is not applicable. If future requirements included features like saving project states, maintaining an edit history, or managing a library of images, a simple file-based storage mechanism or an embedded database like **SQLite** would be a suitable, low-overhead choice, but is not needed for the current scope.

## 6. DevOps Considerations

*   **Deployment:**
    *   **Windows:** **PyInstaller**
        *   **Justification:** PyInstaller is a widely used tool that bundles a Python application and all its dependencies (including Python interpreter, libraries like PyQt and Pillow) into a single executable file. This allows the application to be distributed and run on Windows machines without requiring the user to install Python or the libraries separately, meeting the "standalone exe" requirement.
    *   **Linux:** **Script Distribution with Virtual Environments**
        *   **Justification:** For Linux, the requirement is to run as a Python script. This involves distributing the application source code along with a clear list of dependencies (PyQt, Pillow). It is highly recommended to instruct users to install dependencies within a Python virtual environment (`venv` or `conda`) to avoid conflicts with system-wide Python packages and ensure the correct versions are used. A `requirements.txt` file is essential for managing dependencies.
*   **Infrastructure:** **User's Local Machine**
    *   **Justification:** This is a desktop application. The required infrastructure is simply the end-user's computer (Windows or Linux) meeting the minimal system requirements for running Python, PyQt, and Pillow. There is no server or cloud infrastructure to manage for the application itself.
*   **CI/CD:** **Basic Automated Builds (Optional but Recommended)**
    *   **Justification:** While full CI/CD pipelines might be overkill for a simple desktop app, automating the build process for the Windows executable (using PyInstaller) is recommended to ensure consistent, repeatable builds. Tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or a simple shell script can be used to trigger builds upon code commits. Automated testing (unit tests for processing logic) can also be integrated.

## 7. External Services

*   **Services:** **None Required**
    *   **Justification:** The core functionality (file opening, image processing, display, saving) is entirely self-contained and can be performed using local libraries (Pillow, PyQt) and file system access. No third-party APIs, cloud storage services, or external processing services are needed for the current requirements.
