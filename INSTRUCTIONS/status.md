# Project Status Report: Simple Image Processing App

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** June 7, 2025

---

## 1. Project Summary

**Project Aim:** Develop a cross-platform desktop application using Python, PyQt, and PIL (Pillow) to open JPG and PNG image files and perform basic image processing operations (blurring and cropping) on user-selected regions.

**Target Platforms:**
*   Windows (Packaged as a standalone executable)
*   Linux (Run as a Python script)

**Technology Stack:** Python 3.x, PyQt6 (or PyQt5), Pillow (PIL Fork), potentially PyInstaller for Windows packaging.

**Project Phase:** [e.g., Planning, Development - Sprint 1, Testing, Packaging]

**Current Reporting Period:** [e.g., June 3 - June 7, 2025]
