# Image Editor App PRD

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** June 7, 2025

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for a simple desktop image editing application. The application will allow users to open JPG and PNG image files, view them, select specific rectangular regions, and apply basic editing operations (blur and crop) to these selected regions. Built using Python, the Pillow (PIL) library for image processing, and PyQt for the graphical user interface, the application is intended to be packaged as a standalone executable for Windows and runnable as a Python script on Linux, providing a focused tool for quick, regional image modifications without the complexity of full-featured image editors.

## 2. Product Vision

The vision for this application is to be a lightweight, easy-to-use tool for common, specific image editing tasks, primarily focused on privacy (blurring sensitive information) and basic composition adjustments (cropping to a specific area). We aim to provide a simple, intuitive user interface that allows users to perform these operations quickly and efficiently.

**Purpose:** To offer a focused image editing tool for blurring and cropping specific regions within JPG and PNG files.
**Users:** Individuals needing to quickly edit photos for privacy, social media sharing, basic content creation, or anyone requiring simple, regional image adjustments without resorting to complex software.
**Business Goals:**
*   Deliver a functional, reliable application based on the specified technology stack.
*   Provide a clear and intuitive user experience for the core features (open, view, select region, blur region, crop to region, save).
*   Successfully package and deploy the application for Windows (standalone executable) and ensure compatibility as a script on Linux.

## 3. User Personas

**Persona 1: Sarah, the Social Sharer**

*   **Background:** Uses her phone or digital camera to take photos, frequently shares them with friends and family online. Not tech-savvy regarding photo editing software.
*   **Goals:** Quickly hide faces, license plates, or sensitive document text in photos before sharing them. Wants a fast, simple way to do this on her desktop.
*   **Pain Points:** Finding free online tools that don't compromise privacy, downloading and learning complex software like GIMP or Photoshop, having to edit the whole image when only a small part needs changing.

**Persona 2: Mark, the Hobbyist Blogger**

*   **Background:** Writes a blog about his hobbies (e.g., cooking, gardening). Takes his own photos. Needs images that look presentable but doesn't require professional-grade edits. Comfortable with basic computer tasks but not advanced software.
*   **Goals:** Crop photos to better frame the subject for his blog posts. Occasionally needs to blur out distracting elements in the background or brand logos. Wants a desktop tool he can use offline.
*   **Pain Points:** Photo editing software is expensive or has too many features he doesn't need, finding free software that is reliable and easy to use, online editors can be slow or have limitations.

## 4. Feature Specifications

### 4.1 Open Image File

*   **User Story:** As a user, I want to open a JPG or PNG file from my computer so I can view and edit it within the application.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The application shall have a "File" menu with an "Open..." option.
    *   Clicking "Open..." shall display a file dialog.
    *   The file dialog shall be filtered to show only `.jpg` and `.png` files by default, but allow selecting "All files".
    *   Selecting a valid `.jpg` or `.png` file and confirming shall close the dialog and load the image into the application display area.
    *   If a non-image file or invalid image file is selected, the application shall display an error message to the user (e.g., using a message box) and remain in its idle state.
    *   If the user cancels the file dialog, the application shall remain in its idle state.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   User attempts to open a file that doesn't exist.
    *   User selects a file type other than JPG or PNG (e.g., GIF, BMP, TXT).
    *   The selected image file is corrupted or has invalid data.
    *   The selected file is extremely large (potential memory issues - application should handle gracefully, maybe with a loading indicator or size warning).
    *   File path contains special characters or is very long.

### 4.2 View Image

*   **User Story:** As a user, I want to see the image I opened displayed clearly within the application window.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Once an image is successfully loaded, it shall be displayed in the main content area of the application window.
    *   The image display shall adapt to the window size, potentially scaling the image down to fit or allowing scrolling for larger images that exceed window dimensions. (Start simple: fit to window while maintaining aspect ratio).
    *   The display area shall clear when a new image is opened or if the current image is closed (though explicit "Close Image" isn't required for V1.0).
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Image has unusual aspect ratios (very wide or very tall).
    *   Image resolution is very low or very high.
    *   No image is currently loaded when the application is running.

### 4.3 Select Region

*   **User Story:** As a user, I want to click and drag on the displayed image to define a rectangular area for editing.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   When an image is displayed, the user can click and drag the mouse cursor over the image area.
    *   A visible rectangular outline shall be drawn on the image canvas, indicating the region being selected.
    *   The rectangle shall update in real-time as the user drags the mouse.
    *   Releasing the mouse button shall finalize the selection, and the rectangle outline shall persist, indicating the active selected region.
    *   Clicking anywhere else on the image (without dragging) or initiating a new drag shall clear the previous selection and start a new one.
    *   The application shall internally store the coordinates (top-left x, y, width, height) of the selected region.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   User attempts to select a region when no image is loaded.
    *   User clicks and drags outside the bounds of the image display area.
    *   The selected region has zero width or height (e.g., just a click or drag to a single point).
    *   The user tries to create multiple selections (only one active selection is supported).

### 4.4 Apply Blur to Selected Region

*   **User Story:** As a user, I want to apply a blur effect specifically to the rectangular region I have selected, leaving the rest of the image untouched.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The application shall have a user control (e.g., a button or menu item like "Apply Blur").
    *   This control shall be enabled only when an image is loaded and a valid region is selected.
    *   Clicking "Apply Blur" shall use the stored coordinates of the selected region to apply a blur filter to *only* the pixels within that region of the image data.
    *   The strength of the blur can be a fixed, moderate value for V1.0 (e.g., a Pillow `BoxBlur` or `GaussianBlur` with a radius of 5-10).
    *   The displayed image shall update to show the result of the blur operation applied to the selected region.
    *   The internal image data shall be modified permanently by this operation.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   User attempts to apply blur with no image loaded.
    *   User attempts to apply blur with no region selected.
    *   Selected region is invalid (zero width/height).
    *   Applying blur to a region that is already blurred (should re-apply).
    *   Performance considerations for blurring very large regions (should remain responsive).

### 4.5 Apply Crop to Selected Region

*   **User Story:** As a user, I want to crop the entire image down to the specific rectangular region I have selected.
*   **Accept criteria:**
    *   The application shall have a user control (e.g., a button or menu item like "Apply Crop").
    *   This control shall be enabled only when an image is loaded and a valid region is selected.
    *   Clicking "Apply Crop" shall discard all image data outside the currently selected region.
    *   The dimensions of the image shall be updated to match the dimensions of the selected region.
    *   The displayed image shall update to show only the cropped area.
    *   The internal image data shall be replaced entirely by the cropped section.
    *   The active region selection shall be cleared after the crop operation is applied (as the coordinates no longer match the new image).
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   User attempts to apply crop with no image loaded.
    *   User attempts to apply crop with no region selected.
    *   Selected region is invalid (zero width/height).
    *   Cropping results in a very small image.
    *   User applies blur *then* crops - the blur should be preserved within the resulting cropped area.
    *   User applies crop multiple times (each crop operates on the *currently* displayed image).

### 4.6 Save Edited Image

*   **User Story:** As a user, I want to save the current state of the image, including any applied edits (blur, crop), to a new file.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The application shall have a "File" menu with a "Save As..." option.
    *   Clicking "Save As..." shall display a file dialog prompting the user for a save location and filename.
    *   The file dialog shall allow selecting save format as JPG or PNG.
    *   Saving shall take the *current* internal image data (after all edits) and save it to the specified file path and format.
    *   Saving shall *not* overwrite the original opened file (unless the user explicitly chooses the same path in the "Save As" dialog).
    *   Error handling shall be in place for issues like lack of write permissions or insufficient disk space.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   User attempts to save with no image loaded.
    *   User cancels the save dialog.
    *   User specifies an invalid file path or filename characters.
    *   Disk is full or user lacks permissions to write to the selected directory.
    *   Saving a PNG that originally had transparency after a crop (the cropped area might retain transparency, which is acceptable, but JPG save should convert/flatten).

## 5. Technical Requirements

*   **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
*   **Image Processing Library:** Pillow (PIL fork)
    *   Required functionalities: Opening images (`Image.open`), saving images (`Image.save`), accessing image data, applying filters (`ImageFilter` for blur), cropping (`Image.crop`).
    *   Needs to handle conversion between Pillow `Image` objects and format suitable for PyQt display (e.g., `QPixmap` or `QImage`).
*   **GUI Framework:** PyQt5 or PyQt6 (specify which one for consistency, e.g., PyQt5 for broader compatibility).
    *   Required functionalities: Main window creation, menus (`QMenuBar`, `QMenu`, `QAction`), layout management, image display widget (`QLabel` with `QPixmap` or custom widget), event handling (mouse clicks/drags for region selection, button clicks), file dialogs (`QFileDialog`), message boxes (`QMessageBox`).
*   **Operating Systems:**
    *   Windows (Target for standalone executable)
    *   Linux (Target for Python script execution)
*   **Packaging (Windows):** PyInstaller or similar tool to create a single or minimal set of executable files, bundling Python interpreter and dependencies (Pillow, PyQt).
*   **State Management:**
    *   The application needs to maintain the *current* state of the image in memory as a Pillow `Image` object.
    *   Image operations (blur, crop) modify this in-memory object directly.
    *   The currently selected region coordinates must be stored.
*   **Performance:** Image loading and processing should be reasonably fast for typical desktop image sizes. Large images may introduce latency, which should be managed gracefully (e.g., keeping the UI responsive).
*   **Dependencies:** Management via `pip` and a `requirements.txt` file.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust handling of file I/O errors, invalid image data, and invalid user operations (e.g., attempting blur without selection).

## 6. Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap outlines a phased approach to developing the Image Editor App, prioritizing core functionality for an initial release.

**Phase 1: Core MVP (Estimated Time: 2-4 Weeks)**

*   **Focus:** Implement the fundamental features required by the Executive Summary and Product Vision.
*   **Features:**
    *   Basic PyQt window and application structure.
    *   "File" menu with "Open..." action.
    *   Implement image loading for JPG/PNG using Pillow and display in a PyQt widget.
    *   Implement mouse handling on the image widget for drawing and finalizing a rectangular region selection. Display the selection outline.
    *   Implement the "Apply Blur" function: use Pillow's filter on the selected region of the in-memory image object and update the display. Use a fixed blur radius.
    *   Implement the "Apply Crop" function: use Pillow's crop on the in-memory image object and update the display. Clear the selection after cropping.
    *   Implement the "File" menu with "Save As..." action, allowing saving the current image state as JPG or PNG.
    *   Basic error handling for file operations (open/save).
*   **Outcome:** A functional application capable of opening, displaying, selecting, blurring, cropping, and saving single images.

**Phase 2: Polish & Packaging (Estimated Time: 1-2 Weeks)**

*   **Focus:** Refine the user experience, add necessary error handling, and prepare for distribution.
*   **Features:**
    *   Improve UI feedback (e.g., status bar messages, visual indication when operations are active).
    *   Refine image scaling and display in the window.
    *   Implement more robust error handling (e.g., invalid selections, processing errors, file permissions).
    *   Clear selection indicator when a new image is loaded or after cropping.
    *   Configure and test PyInstaller (or similar) for creating a Windows standalone executable.
    *   Verify application runs correctly as a Python script on a target Linux environment.
*   **Outcome:** A more polished and stable application, packaged and tested for target platforms.

**Phase 3: Future Considerations (Backlog - Not in V1.0 Scope)**

*   Undo/Redo functionality.
*   Adjustable blur strength via a slider or input field.
*   Support for additional image formats (e.g., BMP, TIFF).
*   Drag-and-drop support for opening files.
*   Zoom and pan functionality for large images.
*   Other basic editing tools (e.g., grayscale conversion, rotation).

This roadmap ensures a working, shippable product is delivered in Phase 1, with subsequent phases adding polish and addressing distribution requirements. Future features will be evaluated based on user feedback and evolving needs.
